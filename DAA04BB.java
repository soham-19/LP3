/*
1. Overview of Branch and Bound (B&B)
Purpose: B&B is designed to efficiently handle combinatorial optimization problems by discarding large portions of the solution space that are unlikely to lead to an optimal solution.
Knapsack Context: In the 0/1 Knapsack Problem, we aim to maximize the value in the knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity. B&B selectively explores subsets of items, only diving into those with a high chance of yielding a maximum profit.
2. Key Concepts in B&B for 0/1 Knapsack
Node Representation: Each node in the B&B tree represents a choice (i.e., either including or excluding a specific item).
Levels: Each level in the B&B tree corresponds to an item. At each node, you decide either to:
Include the item (adding its weight and value to the current knapsack configuration).
Exclude the item (skipping to the next item without adding anything).
Bounds: For each node, B&B calculates an upper bound of the maximum possible profit achievable from that node. This bound helps in pruning the search space.
3. Bound Calculation
The bound serves as an estimate of the maximum profit achievable from a particular node onward. It is calculated by:

Adding full items from the current node level onward until the weight limit is reached.
Adding a fraction of the next item (if needed) to partially fill the remaining capacity.
This approach gives a theoretical upper limit on the profit, allowing us to avoid nodes that can't potentially improve the current best solution.

4. Steps in B&B for 0/1 Knapsack
Sort Items by Value-to-Weight Ratio: This sorting helps prioritize items with higher potential for maximizing profit.
Initialize Priority Queue:
The priority queue is used to store nodes based on their bound in descending order, ensuring the node with the highest potential is processed first.
Process Nodes:
Include Current Item: Create a child node representing the inclusion of the current item, calculate its profit, weight, and bound.
Exclude Current Item: Create another child node representing the exclusion of the current item.
Bound Check: If a nodeâ€™s bound is less than the current maximum profit, it is discarded (pruned), as it cannot lead to an optimal solution.
Update Maximum Profit:
As nodes are processed, update the maximum profit if a new higher profit is found at any feasible solution (i.e., a node that does not exceed capacity).
Continue Until Queue is Empty: The algorithm stops when all promising nodes have been processed.
5. Advantages of B&B in Knapsack
Efficient Pruning: B&B prunes large parts of the search space using the bound, leading to potentially significant reductions in computation.
Optimal Solution: Given enough memory and computation time, B&B is guaranteed to find the optimal solution by exploring only feasible configurations with the highest potential.
6. Limitations of B&B in Knapsack
Memory Usage: The B&B tree can grow large, especially for instances with many items, as each level in the tree represents an item decision.
Bound Calculation Complexity: Calculating the bound for each node adds overhead, which may impact performance if not implemented efficiently.

Branch and Bound (B&B) Analysis for 0/1 Knapsack
Time Complexity:

Worst-case: Exponential, O(2^n), as it may explore all subsets if pruning is ineffective.
Average-case: Often much better due to pruning, especially with items sorted by value-to-weight ratio, reducing search space significantly.
Space Complexity:

Depends on the branching, generally O(2^n) in the worst case due to potential storage of all nodes.
Priority queues used for storing nodes add to space usage but aid in efficient pruning.
