    THEORY

### Huffman Encoding: Theory and Concepts

1. **Huffman Encoding**:
   - **What**: A compression algorithm that reduces the number of bits needed to represent a set of characters based on their frequencies.
   - **Why**: Efficient for data compression in text and multimedia files, as characters with higher frequency get shorter codes.
   - **How**: Uses a binary tree structure where each character is assigned a binary code, and no code is a prefix of another (prefix-free coding).

2. **Greedy Approach**:
   - **What**: Huffman Encoding is a greedy algorithm, which means it makes locally optimal choices to build the optimal solution (minimum-cost tree).
   - **Why**: Greedy strategy ensures minimal total bits by combining the lowest-frequency nodes first, progressively building up to the root.

3. **Tree Structure**:
   - **Nodes**: Each leaf node represents a character, and each path from root to leaf represents the binary code of that character.
   - **Internal Nodes**: These are merged nodes without specific characters, used only to organize the tree structure and encode paths.

### Steps in Huffman Encoding (in the Code)

1. **Build Frequency Map**:
   - Input characters and their frequencies into a hashmap to keep track of each characterâ€™s frequency.

2. **Construct the Huffman Tree**:
   - Use a priority queue to store nodes by frequency, with the lowest frequency at the top.
   - Repeatedly merge the two nodes with the lowest frequency until one node remains, representing the root of the Huffman Tree.

3. **Generate Codes**:
   - Traverse the tree from the root, assigning "0" for left branches and "1" for right branches to generate the binary codes for each character.
   - Store these codes in a hashmap for quick access.

4. **Display Codes**:
   - Output each character and its corresponding Huffman code.

### Algorithm Analysis

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - **Building Frequency Map**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of characters.
   - **Building the Tree**: \(O(n \log n)\), due to the priority queue operations.
   - **Generating Codes**: \(O(n)\), because we only traverse the tree once to assign codes.
   - **Overall**: \(O(n \log n)\), primarily dominated by the tree-building step.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - **Storage for Tree and Maps**: \(O(n)\), to store the frequency map, priority queue, and generated codes.
   - **Overall**: \(O(n)\), as each character has its code and node representation in the tree.

### Real-World Applications

- **File Compression**: Used in ZIP and GZIP file compression.
- **Multimedia Compression**: Widely applied in JPEG and MP3 formats to compress image and audio data.
- **Network Communications**: Reduces data size for efficient transmission, as in HTTP data compression.
