        THEORY

### N-Queens Problem: Concepts and Approach

1. **N-Queens Problem**:
   - **What**: Place \( n \) queens on an \( n \times n \) chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
   - **Why**: A classic problem to explore backtracking, recursion, and constraint satisfaction in algorithm design.

2. **Fixed Position for the First Queen**:
   - **Purpose**: Allows the user to place the first queen manually, reducing the number of choices for the rest of the queens.
   - **Impact**: Simplifies the solution by reducing the solution space as one queenâ€™s position is fixed.

3. **Backtracking Strategy**:
   - **What**: A recursive approach that places queens one row at a time and backtracks if a conflict occurs.
   - **Why**: Efficient for constraint satisfaction problems where solutions can be incrementally constructed and pruned.
   - **How**: Each position is checked for validity, and if a queen placement leads to a conflict, the program backtracks, resetting to the previous state.

4. **Constraint Arrays**:
   - **Columns (`cols`)**: Keeps track of which columns are already occupied by a queen.
   - **Main Diagonals (`mainD`)**: Tracks main diagonals (from top-left to bottom-right) for queen conflicts.
   - **Anti-Diagonals (`antiD`)**: Tracks anti-diagonals (from top-right to bottom-left) for queen conflicts.
   - **Purpose**: Prevents placing queens in positions where they can threaten each other, ensuring valid placements.

### Steps of the Algorithm

1. **Initialize the Board**:
   - Create an empty board filled with `'x'` to represent unoccupied cells.

2. **Place the First Queen**:
   - Manually place the first queen based on user input and update the constraint arrays for that position.

3. **Recursive Placement (`nQueens` function)**:
   - For each row, attempt to place a queen in each column.
   - Check if the column, main diagonal, and anti-diagonal are available.
   - If valid, place the queen, update constraints, and recursively call the function for the next row.
   - If a conflict occurs in future placements, backtrack by removing the queen and resetting constraints.

4. **Count Solutions**:
   - Increment the solution count each time a complete valid arrangement is found.

5. **Display Solutions**:
   - Each valid board configuration is printed when found, showing a possible arrangement.

### Algorithm Analysis

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - **Worst-Case**: \( O(n!) \), as each row placement potentially requires checking every column.
   - **Optimization**: Reduces complexity by backtracking early if conflicts are found.
   
2. **Space Complexity**:
   - **Board**: \( O(n^2) \), for storing the board configuration.
   - **Constraint Arrays**: \( O(n) \) for `cols`, \( O(2n-1) \) for diagonals.
   - **Overall**: \( O(n^2) \), mainly due to recursive stack usage and board storage.

### Real-World Applications

- **Resource Allocation**: Solving allocation problems where resources must be placed without conflicts.
- **Scheduling**: Useful in job scheduling where constraints prevent certain jobs from being placed together.
- **Puzzle Solving**: This approach applies to other backtracking problems like Sudoku or crosswords.
